## Description
This project challenge was to create a working weather app. In this challenge we implemented using fetch calls to gather data from a third party source . 
I gathered inspo from the example that was given, and made it similar with different color theme. So now, anyone who may be traveling will be able to access this weather app that gives a current day forecast, and a five day forecast. The data recieved from the openweather api can help the user prepare activities for the day, and maybe even how to dress for the day. I learned to convert  temperature from Kelvin to Fahrenheit in this challenge. Also learned how to format date, and manipulate array for the saved cities in local storage. 

## Installation

N/a

## Usage

Upon arrival to page , a prompt should iniate asking approval to allow sharing location. If approved current location weather would be displayed, otherwise error message would display. User can then type in name of city and press search to display current weather, and five day forecast. The app stores up to 8 cities history that was searched, and replaces the oldest search everytime user initiates another search.
